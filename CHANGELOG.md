# Decode My Boss — Changelog

## v9.0 (2026-03-29) — Pre-launch Polish

### Added
- **Message Stats Bar** — real-time word count and character count displayed under the textarea; warning "Short messages may give less accurate results" shown when word count is between 1 and 9 words
- **Share on X** — "Share on X" button in result actions opens Twitter intent URL in a new tab with tweet text: "My boss's message scored X/10 on the toxicity scale [unlock emoji] Check yours: [URL]"
- **Export History** — "Export History" button in the history section header downloads all decode history as a formatted JSON file via Blob + URL.createObjectURL

### Changed
- Textarea input handler refactored into reusable `updateMsgStats()` function called from all text-filling paths (examples, templates, URL share, re-decode, new analysis)
- SW cache bumped to `decode-my-boss-v9.0`

### Preserved
- All v8.x features intact (templates library, history summary cards, share as link)
- All AI integration (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) untouched
- Share card canvas generation unchanged
- Feedback widget unchanged

## v8.0 (2026-03-29) — Enhanced Decode Experience

### Added
- **Message Templates Library** — collapsible "Common Boss Messages" section with 11 pre-built templates across 3 categories: Passive-Aggressive (4), Power Moves (4), Vague Threats (3); clicking a template fills textarea and auto-decodes if API key is configured
- **Decode History Enhancement** — clicking a history item now shows a compact summary card with toxicity score, verdict, top 2 red flags (with severity coloring), and first decoded phrase; "Decode Again" button re-fills textarea and triggers new analysis; "Back" button returns to input
- **Share as Link** — new "Share as link" button in result actions copies URL with `?example=encoded-text` to clipboard; opening the URL auto-fills the textarea with the decoded text
- History entries now store additional data: `top_flags` (top 2 flags with type/severity), `first_decoded` (first decoded phrase), `full_message` (up to 300 chars for re-decode)

### Changed
- URL `?example=` parameter now supports both chip slugs (v7 compat) and URL-encoded full text (v8)
- SW cache bumped to `decode-my-boss-v8.0`

### Preserved

- All AI integration (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) untouched
- Share card canvas generation unchanged
- Feedback widget unchanged

## v7.0 (2026-03-29) — PWA Install, Keyboard Shortcut & URL Share

- **Keyboard Shortcut** — `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` triggers decode when textarea is focused and button is enabled
- **URL Share for Examples** — clicking an example chip adds `?example=slug` to URL via `replaceState`; loading page with `?example=per-my-last-email` auto-fills textarea with matching example text

### Changed

### Preserved
- All v6.x features intact (decode, draft response, tone slider, copy, examples, history, share card, feedback)

### Added

- **Toxicity countUp animation** — score animates from 0 to final value over 1.2s with ease-out easing using `requestAnimationFrame`
- **Toxicity bar ARIA** — `role="progressbar"`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin="0"`, `aria-valuemax="10"`, `aria-label="Toxicity score"` on the toxicity bar element
- **Tone tag sanitization** — CSS class names from AI tone labels sanitized via `.replace(/[^a-z_]/g, '')` to prevent class injection / XSS

### Changed
